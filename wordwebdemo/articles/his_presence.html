		<h1>Access To The Throne Room of God</h1>
		<h2>Jesus Died on the Cross to Give Believers Direct Access to the Father</h2>
		
		<p>In the Old Testament, inside the tabernacle (tent of meeting) and the temple were the Holy Place and the Most 
		Holy Place (also called the Holy of Holies) where only the High Priest could go once a year to offer sacrifices for 
		his sins and the sins of the people. <i>"But Christ came as High Priest ... Not with the blood of goats and calves, 
		but with His own blood He entered the Most Holy Place once for all, having obtained eternal redemption."</i> 
		(Hebrews 9:11, 12)<br /><br /> 

		When Jesus died on the cross, three of the Gospels state that the veil separating the Holy Place and the Most Holy 
		Place was torn in two. This was symbolic, indicating that direct access to the presence of God was now available for 
		all believers. <br />

		The word access only appears three times in the New Testament. It simply means introduction or entrance. Each time it 
		is written in the Bible it is referring to Jesus and what He accomplished for believers.<br /><br />
		<i>"Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom also 
		we have access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God."</i> (Romans 5:1,2)<br />
		<i>"For through Him we both have access by one Spirit to the Father."</i>(Ephesians 2:18)<br />
		<i>"In whom we have boldness and access with confidence through faith in Him."</i>(Ephesians 3:12)<br />
		Through the death of Jesus, his resurrection and ascension, believers have access into God's grace, access by one Spirit 
		to the Father, access with confidence. The Amplified Bible translates Ephesians 3:12 with enlightening clarity. 
		<i>"In Whom, because of our faith in Him, we dare to have the boldness (courage and confidence) of free access (an 
		unreserved approach to God with freedom and without fear)."</i><br /><br />
		Jesus made known God as the Heavenly Father Who:<br />
		sees in secret and rewards openly<br />
		knows things needed before being asked<br />
		gives good things to those who ask<br />
		makes all things possible<br />
		raises the dead and gives life to them<br />
		is love and light<br />
		has no darkness at all<br />
		<i>"Seeing then that we have a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold 
		fast our confession. For we do not have a High Priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but was in all points 
		tempted as we are, yet without sin. Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and 
		find grace to help in time of need."</i> (Hebrews 4:14-16) <br /><br />

		In Eden, Adam had a relationship with God. They walked and talked together in the garden during the cool of the day. 
		That relationship was damaged, but God had a plan to restore and reconcile man to Himself through Jesus Christ making 
		obtainable the way back into His presence. When Jesus said, It is finished, direct access to God the Father was 
		re-established forever. Gods Word says believers are to come boldly to the throne of grace.<br /><br /> 

		Unlike the massive darkened hall of the Emerald Palace where the Wizard of Oz projects himself through smoke and mirrors, 
		believers have immediate access to the throne room of God. He is real, merciful and always gives grace to help in time of need.<br />
