		<h1>God Does Not Cause Suffering - Satan Does!</h1>
		<h2>Suffering Leads to Many Spiritual Lessons</h2>
		<p>It may take a mental stretch to think of suffering as a blessing, spiritual or otherwise. But it is a very important 
		subject in the Word of God. Without the suffering and sacrifice of Jesus Christ, there would be no salvation. One might 
		think that all the suffering should be over since Jesus paid the price for all mankind, but unfortunately, there is still 
		suffering in this world and in this life. Although unpleasant and sometimes unspeakable, there are many lessons to learn 
		from suffering. From that perspective, it is a spiritual blessing.<br /><br />

		Though Jesus was the Song of God, <i>"He learned obedience by the things which He suffered."</i> (Hebrews 5:8) Jesus prayed 
		in the Garden of Gethsemane for another way other than crucifixion.<br />

		Yet He submitted Himself to God, <i>"O My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me; nevertheless, not as I will, 
		but as You will."</i> (Matthew 26:39) After praying the same prayer three times, it was clear that there was no other 
		way so Jesus courageously did the will of God. <i>"He humbled Himself and became obedient to the point of death, even the 
		death of the cross."</i> (Philippians 2:8) Thank God that Jesus chose to suffer, a choice that paved the way back to God 
		for all mankind.<br /><br />

		Not all who suffer choose to do so, but once in the midst of it, people make critical decisions. Job is another unbelievable 
		example. After learning of the sudden tragic loss of all his children, his employees and his livestock, his reaction was to 
		fall down and worship God. When covered head to toe with boils, Job 2:10 says that Job did not sin with his lips. <i>"In all 
		this Job did not sin nor charge God with wrong."</i> (1:22) Many Bible scholars believe Job was the first book written, 
		chronologically. It is noteworthy to consider that one of the first lessons God wants His people to learn is that although 
		there is suffering in this life, He is the great Savior. <i>"My brethren, take the prophets, who spoke in the name of the Lord, 
		as an example of suffering and patience. Indeed we count them blessed who endure. You have heard of the perseverance of Job 
		and seen the end intended by the Lord; that the Lord is very compassionate and merciful."</i> (James 5:10, 11) The book of 
		Revelation, foretelling future perfection, agrees. <i>"And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes; there shall be no 
		more death, nor sorrow, nor crying. There shall be no more pain, for the former things have passed away."</i> (21:4)<br /><br />

		God has a future planned without suffering. The Christian's hope includes heaven, being eternally in the presence of God. 
		Hope also includes the destruction of Satan, sin, sickness, suffering and death. <i>"For I consider that the sufferings of 
		this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us."</i> (Romans 8:18) Until then, 
		suffering educates and strengthens.<br /><br />

		Helen Keller was an American author, activist and lecturer. She was the first deaf-blind person to graduate from college. 
		She said, <i>"Character cannot be developed in ease and quiet. Only through experience of trial and suffering can the soul 
		be strengthened, vision cleared, ambition inspired, and success achieved."</i><br /><br />

		When suffering is viewed as having a purpose, one can learn from it, and use it for the benefit of teaching or helping others. 
		Jesus Christ suffered willingly and by design. <i>"For Christ also suffered once for sins, the just for the unjust, that 
		He might bring us to God."</i> (1 Peter 3:18) Without His suffering for humanity, there would be no restoration or 
		reconciliation with God.<br /><br />

		Jesus' suffering was with a divine purpose. Contemporary author and motivational speaker, Robert Ringer, recently wrote, 
		<i>"The most worthwhile lessons in life are the ones we learn through adversity. Some day you may be in a situation that 
		will require you to draw on that experience, perhaps to help someone dear to you through a similar issue."</i><br /><br />

		There are worse things than suffering in life, and perhaps worse than suffering is not learning anything from the experience. 
		All humans go through different kinds and various degrees of suffering, and some live lives full of it. Since no one is 
		exempt, rather than to complain about it, which no one wants to listen to, Christians are encouraged in Hebrews chapter 12 
		to remember what Jesus went through on the cross, enduring the most extreme suffering any one ever went through, <i>"lest 
		you become weary and discouraged in your souls."</i> (12:3) God promises that He <i>"will Himself complete and make you what 
		you ought to be, establish and ground you securely, and strengthen, and settle you."</i> (1 Peter 5:10 Amplified Bible)<br /><br />
