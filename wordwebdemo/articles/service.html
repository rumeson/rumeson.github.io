			<h1>Finding Your Ministry As a New Believer</h1>
			<h2>Church Ministry involves Many People with Hands and Hearts for Service</h2>
			<p>God accomplished the plan of redemption and salvation through the sacrifice of His Son, Jesus Christ. 
			Therefore, Christians are complete in Christ. Absolutely nothing is missing. There are so many spiritual 
			blessings it is hard to remember them all from day to day. God has provided a plentiful and purposeful life 
			now, and also has an out-of-this-world future prepared. The spiritual blessing of service in the ministry 
			was created so that believers could carry out the various services needed to guide people through the Christian 
			lifestyle. The Christian way of life is to glorify God, spreading His Word, teaching and training His people 
			to be disciples of Jesus Christ, and living and working as a family. The ministry is the service vehicle 
			to achieve this.<br />

			The ministry is multi-faceted and necessitates the commitment and involvement of many people. In the Old Testament, 
			literally thousands of people were involved in the varied services of the tabernacle, and later, in Solomon's temple 
			in Jerusalem. Even in a small church today, there are many aspects of the ministry to oversee and perform.<br />

			Acts chapter six records an organizational meeting in the early church. <i>"Now in those days, when the number of 
			the disciples was multiplying, there arose a complaint against the Hebrews by the Hellenists (Greek speaking Jews), 
			because their widows were neglected in the daily distribution. Then the twelve summoned the multitude of the 
			disciples and said, 'It is not desirable that we should leave the word of God and serve tables. Therefore, brethren, 
			seek out from among you seven men of good reputation, full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom, whom we may appoint over 
			this business; but we will give ourselves continually to prayer and to the ministry of the word.'"</i><br /><br />

			The church in Jerusalem had thousands of people participating, and there was a daily food distribution program. When 
			an administrative problem arose, the top leadership, the 12 apostles, evaluated the situation and called a meeting 
			to delegate supervisory responsibilities to qualified disciples. This is the business of the church -- the work of 
			the ministry. The selection of the seven men, including Stephen and Philip, brought about excellent results. 
			<i>"Then the word of God spread, and the number of the disciples multiplied greatly in Jerusalem."</i><br /><br />

			All of the diverse physical behind-the-scenes workings of the ministry are to support the main purposes, which are 
			preaching, teaching and training people in the Word and ways of God. The heart of the ministry is the Word of God, 
			its truth, its message, its practical instructions. Jesus Christ commissioned His disciples, as recorded in Matthew 
			28:19, 20, Mark 16:15-20, Luke 24:47 and Acts 1:8. The electrifying book of Acts shows how these directives were 
			successfully carried out with the dynamic power of God. About 3,000 people came to the Lord in chapter two, another 
			5,000 in chapter four, and multitudes in chapter five. This vital part of the ministry is called the ministry of 
			reconciliation. <i>"Now all things are of God, who has reconciled us to Himself through Jesus Christ, and has given us 
			the ministry of reconciliation, that is, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, not imputing their 
			trespasses to them, and has committed to us the word of reconciliation."</i> (2 Corinthians 5:18, 19)<br /><br />

			The ministry of reconciling people back to God has been given to Christians. To reconcile means to bring back together 
			that which has been separated. Christians have a message to deliver, to lead people to Jesus Christ, into the 
			kingdom of God. The ministry is to work like a synchronized machine, so to speak, to offer safe passage from the 
			secular world into a healthy household of God's people. It is called the ministry of the Spirit, the ministry of 
			righteousness, the ministry of the saints. What a fantastic spiritual blessing!
